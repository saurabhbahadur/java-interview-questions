<p align="center" > (Java Development) </p>

# Spring 

+ It is framework which is developed using Java language. It contains large number number of inbuilt libraries which we can import to our project and reuse them. 
+ `What It Is:` A comprehensive Java framework for building enterprise-level applications. It simplifies the development of Java-based applications by providing infrastructure support.
+ `Key Features:` Dependency Injection (DI), Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), and integration with various frameworks and tools.


# Apache Tomcat
+ Server to run the spring Applications
+ `What It Is:` An open-source Java servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation.
+ `Purpose:` It serves Java web applications and provides an environment to run Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP).
+ `Use Case:` Often used as a lightweight and efficient web server in development and production environments.

# Spring Boot

+ `spring` + `internal embeded tomcat(inbuilt)` + `xml configuration`
+ `What It Is:` An extension of the Spring Framework designed to simplify the development of Spring-based applications.
+ `Key Features:`
  + Embedded servers like Tomcat or Jetty for standalone deployment.
  + Auto-configuration to reduce boilerplate code.
  + Opinionated defaults for rapid application development.
  
# Maven Repository

+ It is already existing website or repository where all libraries (dependency) are present.  
+ `What It Is:` A storage location for project dependencies (libraries, plugins, etc.) used in a Maven project.
  
# Maven (mvn)

+ It is a tool used to download the libraries or dependencies into our project. And build the spring projects without any errors

# Maven Lifecycle

+ Create `->` download dependencies `->` add code `->` build `->` run `->` test `->` deploy
+ `What It Is:` A sequence of predefined phases to build, test, and deploy a Java project.

+ `Build` Check for errors in the projects and it creates a jar files of the application
+ `Deploy` the jar file created will go to server which will be running
+ Maven is a tool which maintains the whole lifecycle of the spring project.

# pom.xml (Project Object Model)
  + It is an xml file which contains information about project, configurations about project and dependencies or libraries which are added from repository

# Spring IOC(Inversion of control) container

+ Everything from creation, maintenance, destruction of object is done by IOC container.

### Bean

+ Objects created by IOC container in spring.
+ We use `@Autowired` to create internal bean(IOC)

## Coupling

+ `Loose coupling` - One object not dependent on another object
+ `Tight coupling` - One object dependent on another object

# IOC (Inversion of control)

# Spring IOC 

+ It creates the object, configure it, add the dependencies, and manage their life cycle and destroy it. IOC uses the principle of Dependency Injection

# DI (Dependency Injection)
+ It makes our code loosely coupled. 
+ Setter injection and Constructor injection are the two types of dependency injection.

# Scope of Bean

  + ##  Singleton Scope
      + Only one instance/object/copy of that bean is used throughout the application 
  + ##  Prototype Scope
      + It can create any number of object instances
